FNN linked. In FOCA, the FNN (Font Name map)
structured field permits the mapping of a set of IBM
GCGIDs to the character index values that occur in either a
CMAP file or a rearranged file. Because the set of GCGIDs
and the set of character index values must correspond to
the same set of characters, it is necessary to identify which
CMAP or rearranged file (among the many that could be
located in a font file system) is associated (linked) with the
FNN structured field. Note that the Font Name Map is
known as the Character ID Map in IPDS.
FOCA. See Font Object Content Architecture.
font. A set of graphic characters that have a characteristic
design, or a font designer's concept of how the graphic
characters should appear. The characteristic design
specifies the characteristics of its graphic characters.
Examples of characteristics are character shape, graphic

of fonts are fully described fonts, symbol sets, and their
internal printer representations. See also coded font and
symbol set.

graphic characters in a font. Synonymous with vertical font
size. (2) In a font character set, nominal font height is a
font-designer defined value corresponding to the nominal
distance between adjacent baselines when character
rotation is zero degrees and no external leading is used.
This distance represents the baseline-to-baseline
increment that includes the font's maximum baseline extent
and the designer's recommendation for internal leading.
The font designer can also define a minimum and a
maximum vertical font size to represent the limits of
scaling. (3) In font referencing, the specified font height is
the desired size of the font when the characters are
presented. If this size is different from the nominal vertical
font size specified in a font character set, the character
shapes and character metrics might need to be scaled
prior to presentation.
font index. (1) The mapping of a descriptive font name to
a font member name in a font library. An example of a font
member in a font library is a font resource object.
Examples of attributes used to form a descriptive font
name are typeface, family name, point size, style, weight
class, and width class. (2) In the IPDS architecture, an
LF1-type raster-font resource containing character metrics
for each code point of a raster font or raster-font section for
a particular font inline sequence. There can be a font index
for 0 degree, 90 degree, 180 degree, and 270 degree font
inline sequences. A font index can be downloaded to a
printer using the Load Font Index command. An LF1-type
coded font or coded-font section is the combination of one
fully described font and one font index. See also fully
described font.

direction relative to a character pattern. Character rotation
and font inline sequence are related in that character
rotation is a clockwise rotation; font inline sequence is a

the controlling environment to a named resource to identify
a font. See also local identifier.
font metrics. Measurement information that defines
individual character values such as height, width, and
space, as well as overall font values such as averages and
maximums. Font metrics can be expressed in specific fixed
units, such as pels, or in relative units that are independent
of both the resolution and the size of the font. See also
character metrics and character set metrics.
font modification parameters. Parameters that alter the
appearance of a typeface.
font object. A resource object that contains some or all of
the description of a font.
Font Object Content Architecture (FOCA). An
architected collection of constructs used to describe fonts
and to interchange those font descriptions.
font production. A method used to create a font. This
method includes designing each character image,
converting the character images to a digital-technology
format, defining parameter values for each character,
assigning appropriate descriptive and identifying
information, and creating a font resource that contains the
required information in a format that can be used by a text
processing system. Digital-technology formats include bit
image, vector drawing orders, and outline algorithms.
Parameter values include such attributes as height, width,
and escapement.
font referencing. A method used to identify or
characterize a font. Examples of processes that use font
referencing are document editing, document formatting,
and document presentation.
Font Typeface Global Identifier (FGID). A unique font
identifier that can be expressed as either a two-byte binary
or a five-digit decimal value. The FGID is used to identify a
type style and the following characteristics: posture, weight
class, and width class.
font width (FW). (1) A characteristic value, parallel to the
character baseline, that represents the size of all graphic
FNN linked • font width (FW) [MODCA-GLO-034]


characters in a font. Synonymous with horizontal font
size. (2) In a font character set, nominal font width is a
font-designer defined value corresponding to the nominal
character increment for a font character set. The value is
generally the width of the space character and is defined
differently for fonts with different spacing characteristics.
• For fixed-pitch, uniform character increment fonts: the [MODCA-GLO-035]
fixed character increment, that is also the space
character increment
• For PSM fonts: the width of the space character [MODCA-GLO-036]
• For typographic, proportionally spaced fonts: one-third of [MODCA-GLO-037]
the vertical font size, that is also the default size of the
space character.
The font designer can also define a minimum and a
maximum horizontal font size to represent the limits of
scaling. (3) In font referencing, the specified font width is
the desired size of the font when the characters are
presented. If this size is different from the nominal
horizontal font size specified in a font character set, the
character shapes and character metrics might need to be
scaled prior to presentation.
foreground. (1) The part of a presentation space that is
occupied by object data. (2) In GOCA, the portion of a

background color.
foreground mix. An attribute used to determine how the
foreground color of data is combined with the existing color
of a graphics presentation space. An example of data is a
graphics primitive. Contrast with background mix.
form. A division of the physical medium; multiple forms
can exist on a physical medium. For example, a roll of
paper might be divided by a printer into rectangular pieces
of paper, each representing a form. Envelopes are an
example of a physical medium that comprises only one
form. The IPDS architecture defines four types of
forms: cut-sheet media, continuous-form media,
envelopes, and computer output on microfilm. Each type of
form has a top edge. A form has two sides, a front side and
a back side. Synonymous with sheet.
format. The arrangement or layout of data on a physical
medium or in a presentation space.
formatter. A process used to prepare a document for
presentation.
formblend. (1) In IPDS, this mixing rule is only used
when a preprinted form overlay (PFO) is merged as
presentation space P
PFO with other presentation data
(presentation space P data). The intersection of P PFO and
Pdata is assigned the following color attribute:
• Wherever the color attribute of P PFO is either color of [MODCA-GLO-038]
medium, or “white” (CMYK = X'00000000' for a printer,
RGB = X'FFFFFF' for an RGB display), the intersection
is assigned the color attribute of P data. Likewise,
wherever the color attribute of P data is either color of
medium, or “white” (CMYK = X'00000000' for a printer,
RGB = X'FFFFFF' for an RGB display), the intersection
is assigned the color attribute of P PFO.
• With other overlapping color values, the intersection [MODCA-GLO-039]
assumes a new color attribute that is generated in a
device-specific manner to simulate how the P
data color
attribute would mix onto a preprinted form that has the
color attribute of P
PFO. In general, this mixing is a
blending of the color attributes of P data and PPFO that is
determined by the two color attributes and by the print
media and the print technology.
See also mixing rule. (2) In MO:DCA, this mixing rule is
only used when a simulated preprinted form, which is
simulated as either a Medium Preprinted Form overlay (M-
PFO) or a PMC Preprinted Form overlay (PMC-PFO), is
merged as a new presentation space P
n, onto an existing
presentation space P e. The intersection of the foregrounds
of Pn and Pe is assigned the following color attribute:
• Wherever the color attribute of P e is either the color of [MODCA-GLO-040]
medium, or the color white (CMYK = X'00000000' or
RGB = X'FFFFFF'), the intersection is assigned the color
attribute of P n.
• Wherever the color attribute of P e is not the color of [MODCA-GLO-041]
medium and not the color white, the intersection
assumes a new color attribute that is generated in a
device-specific manner to simulate how the P e color
attribute would mix onto a preprinted form that has the
color attribute of P
n. In general, this mixing is a blending
of the color attributes of P n and Pe that is determined by
the two color attributes and by the print media and the
print technology.

typography, a grapheme is the fundamental unit in written
language. Graphemes include alphabetic letters, Chinese
characters, numerals, punctuation marks, and all the
individual symbols of any of the world's writing systems. In

horizontal font size. (1) A characteristic value, parallel to
the character baseline, that represents the size of all
graphic characters in a font. Synonymous with font
width. (2) In a font character set, nominal horizontal font
size is a font-designer defined value corresponding to the
nominal character increment for a font character set. The
value is generally the width of the space character and is
defined differently for fonts with different spacing
characteristics.
• For fixed-pitch, uniform character increment fonts: the [MODCA-GLO-061]
fixed character increment, that is also the space
character increment
• For PSM fonts: the width of the space character [MODCA-GLO-062]
• For typographic fonts and proportionally spaced fonts: [MODCA-GLO-063]
one-third of the vertical font size, that is also the default

The font designer can also define a minimum and a
maximum horizontal font size to represent the limits of
scaling. (3) In font referencing, the specified horizontal font
size is the desired size of the font when the characters are
presented. If this size is different from the nominal
horizontal font size specified in a font character set, the
character shapes and character metrics might need to be
scaled prior to presentation.

determined by dividing the horizontal scale factor by the
vertical font size. If the value specified is greater or less
than the specified vertical font size, the graphic characters
and their corresponding metric values are stretched or
compressed in the horizontal direction relative to the
vertical direction by the scaling ratio indicated.
host. (1) In the IPDS architecture, a computer that drives
a printer. (2) In IOCA, the host is the controlling
environment.
Host-Assigned ID (HAID). A two-byte ID in the range
X'0001'–X'7EFF' that is assigned to an IPDS resource by a

which case the HAID can be reused. HAIDs are used in
IPDS resource management commands.
Host-Assigned Resource ID. The combination of a
Host-Assigned ID with a section identifier, or a font inline

ICC. See International Color Consortium.
ICC-absolute colorimetric. A rendering intent in which
the chromatically adapted tristimulus values of the in-
gamut colors are unchanged. It is useful for spot colors and
when simulating one medium on another (proofing). Note
that this definition of ICC-absolute colorimetry is actually
called “relative colorimetry” in CIE terminology, since the
data has been normalized relative to the perfect diffuser
viewed under the same illumination source as the sample.
ICC DeviceLink profile. An ICC profile that provides a
mechanism in which to save and store a series of device
profiles and non-device profiles in a concatenated format
as long as the series begins and ends with a device profile.
This is useful for workflows where a combination of device
profiles and non-device profiles are used repeatedly.
ICC profile. A file in the International Color Consortium
profile format, containing information about the color
reproduction capabilities of a device such as a scanner, a
digital camera, a monitor, or a printer. An ICC profile
includes three elements: 128-byte file header, tag table,
and tagged element data. The intent of this format is to
provide a cross-platform device profile format. Such device
profiles can be used to translate color data created on one
device into another device's native color space.

Defining “white” as daylight will give unacceptable results
when attempting to color correct a photograph taken with
incandescent lighting.
